# The Data Problem
Data has a fundemental problem. It comes from somewhere, and it goes somewhere. 
Sometimes those somewheres are the same kind of somewhere, and everything is good.

But sometimes, that data comes from somewhere, to go somewhere very different. 
And then you need a transformation.
And where does that transform live? What is fair?
Should the source format to the destination's preference.
Or should the destination translate from whatever is easiest for the source.
Should they do a little of both (please no). 
Or should they hire a translator to sit in the middle?
Serious questions.
